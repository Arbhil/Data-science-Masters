    "## Q1. What is Statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Statistics is the science of collecting, organising and analyzing the data.\n",
    "## Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of statistics:\n",
    "* Descriptive statistics: It is used for organizing and summerizing the data. e.g- Measurement of central tendency, Measure of dispersion ctc.\n",
    "* Inferencial statistics: It is used to draw conclusion about the measured data. methods i.e- z-test, t-test etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Qualitative or Categorical Data:\n",
    "Qualitative or Categorical Data is data that can’t be measured or counted in the form of numbers. These types of data are sorted by category, not by number. That’s why it is also known as Categorical Data. These data consist of audio, images, symbols, or text. The gender of a person, i.e., male, female, or others, is qualitative data.\n",
    "The Qualitative data are further classified into two parts :\n",
    "1. Nominal Data:\n",
    "Nominal Data is used to label variables without any order or quantitative value. The color of hair can be considered nominal data, as one color can’t be compared with another color.\n",
    "* e.g- \n",
    "Colour of hair (Blonde, red, Brown, Black, etc.),\n",
    "Marital status (Single, Widowed, Married),\n",
    "Nationality (Indian, German, American),\n",
    "Gender (Male, Female, Others),\n",
    "Eye Color (Black, Brown, etc.)\n",
    "2. Ordinal Data:\n",
    "Ordinal data have natural ordering where a number is present in some kind of order by their position on the scale. These data are used for observation like customer satisfaction, happiness, etc., but we can’t do any arithmetical tasks on them. \n",
    "- Examples of Ordinal Data :\n",
    "When companies ask for feedback, experience, or satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10,\n",
    "Letter grades in the exam (A, B, C, D, etc.),\n",
    "Ranking of people in a competition (First, Second, Third, etc.),\n",
    "Economic Status (High, Medium, and Low),\n",
    "Education Level (Higher, Secondary, Primary).\n",
    "#### Quantitative Data: \n",
    "Quantitative data can be expressed in numerical values, making it countable and including statistical data analysis. These kinds of data are also known as Numerical data. It answers the questions like “how much,” “how many,” and “how often.” For example, the price of a phone, the computer’s ram, the height or weight of a person, etc., falls under quantitative data. \n",
    "The Quantitative data are further classified into two parts :\n",
    "1. Discrete Data:\n",
    "The term discrete means distinct or separate. The discrete data contain the values that fall under integers or whole numbers. The total number of students in a class is an example of discrete data. These data can’t be broken into decimal or fraction values.\n",
    "- Examples of Discrete Data : \n",
    "Total numbers of students present in a class,\n",
    "Cost of a cell phone,\n",
    "Numbers of employees in a company.\n",
    "2. Continuous Data:\n",
    "Continuous data are in the form of fractional numbers. It can be the version of an android phone, the height of a person, the length of an object, etc. Continuous data represents information that can be divided into smaller levels. The continuous variable can take any value within a range. \n",
    "- Examples of Continuous Data : \n",
    "Height of a person,\n",
    "Speed of a vehicle,\n",
    "“Time-taken” to finish the work,\n",
    "Wi-Fi Frequency,\n",
    "Market share price.\n",

    "## Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The four measurement levels, in order, from the lowest level of information to the highest level of information are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nominal scales:\n",
    "* Nominal scales contain the least amount of information. In nominal scales, the numbers assigned to each variable or observation are only used to classify the variable or observation. \n",
    "* For example, a fund manager may choose to assign the number 1 to small-cap stocks, the number 2 to corporate bonds, the number 3 to derivatives, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ordinal scales\n",
    "* Ordinal scales present more information than nominal scales and are, therefore, a higher level of measurement. In ordinal scales, there is an ordered relationship between the variable’s observations. \n",
    "* For example, a list of 500 managers of mutual funds may be ranked by assigning the number 1 to the best-performing manager, the number 2 to the second best-performing manager, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "* With this type of measurement, one can conclude that the number 1-ranked mutual fund manager performed better than the number 2-ranked mutual fund manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interval scales:\n",
    "* Interval scales present more information than ordinal scales in that they provide assurance that the differences between values are equal. In other words, interval scales are ordinal scales but with equivalent scale values from low to high intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For example, temperature measurement is an example of an interval scale: 60°C is colder than 65°C, and the temperature difference is the same as the difference between 50°C and 55°C. In other words, the difference of 5°C in both intervals shares the same interpretation and meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A drawback in interval scales is that they do not have a true zero point. Zero does not represent an absence of something in an interval scale. Consider that the temperature -0°C does not represent the absence of temperature. For this reason, interval-scale-based ratios fail to provide some insights – for example, 50°C is not twice as hot as 25°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ratio scales:\n",
    "* Ratio scales are the most informative scales. Ratio scales provide rankings, assure equal differences between scale values, and have a true zero point. In essence, a ratio scale can be thought of as nominal, ordinal, and interval scales combined as one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For example, the measurement of money is an example of a ratio scale. An individual with Rs.0 has an absence of money. With a true zero point, it would be correct to say that someone with Rs.100 has twice as much money as someone with Rs.50.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Levels of measurement are important because they indicate the extent to which statisticians, marketing analysts and financial analysts can use existing data. For instance, if we classify our data at the ordinal level of measurement, we know that we can evaluate how items compare to each other based on a specific hierarchy. If we wanted to analyze the exact distance between items rather than understand only how they compare to one another, we might want to rely on data at the interval level of measurement.\n",

    "|They don’t provide any quantitative value, neither can we perform any arithmetical operation\t|They provide sequence and can assign numbers to ordinal data but cannot perform the arithmetical operation|\n",
    "|Nominal data cannot be used to compare with one another\t|Ordinal data can help to compare one item with another by ranking or ordering|\n",

    "## Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.\n",
    "1. Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "* Mean: The sum of all measurements divided by the number of observations.Can be used with discrete and continuous data. It is value that is most common\n",
    "* Median: The middle value that separates the higher half from the lower half. Mean and median can be compared with each other to determine if the population is of normal distribution or not. Numbers are arranged in either ascending or descending order. The middle number is than taken.\n",
    "* Mode: The most frequent value. It shows most popular option and is the highest bar in histogram.Example of use: to determine the most common blood group.\n",
    "2. Measures of variability\n",
    "* Variance: A measure of how far a set of numbers are spread out from each other. It describes how far the numbers lie from the mean (expected value). It is the square of standard deviation.\n",
    "* Standard deviation (SD): it is only used for data that are “normally distributed”. SD indicates how much a set of values is spread around the average.SD is determined by the variance (SD=the root of the variance)."
